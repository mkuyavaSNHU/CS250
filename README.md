1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User Stories provide a simple definition of the project requirements in a way that is easy for the user to convey and for the developers to understand. Because the 	user stories follow a general format, “As a <role> I want <to be able to do something> so that <benefit>”, it is easy to determine the requirements and benefits, this assists in determining the priority of the backlog for implementation
	
2)How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The agile process I look to incorporate: test-driven development, code refactoring, adaptive planning, continual improvement, user stories, Kanban process. 

3)What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	
A good software development team member should have good communication skills and professionalism, be open to receiving and applying feedback, and be self-motivated and organized.
